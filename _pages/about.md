I am a PhD Candidate with Prof. Branko Kerkez at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Through this degree I will complement my background in hydrology and hydraulics with coursework in intelligent infrastructure systems and artificial intelligence while working on some of the largest water sensor networks in the world. I look forward to leveraging this coursework and experience to contribute to the intersection of artificial intelligence, real-time sensing and control, and hydraulic engineering in order to improve the quality of life, economic prosperity, and safety of communities.
