I am a PhD Candidate with Prof. Branko Kerkez at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. My research focuses on model discovery in low observability environments. In other words: how do you design a controller for a system with very few sensors?

The PhD has complemented my background in hydrology and hydraulics with coursework in control systems theory that's positioned me well for contributing to the intersection of artificial intelligence, real-time sensing and control, and hydraulic engineering.
