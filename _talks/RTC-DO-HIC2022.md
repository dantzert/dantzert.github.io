*Short abstract.* Real-time control may enable stormwater networks to manage stormwater
pollution and create optimal conditions for aquatic life. The limited number of real-world case
studies has hindered the acceptance and adoption of these autonomous solutions. In particular,
no studies have explored the in-situ, real-time control of water quality directly. To that end, we
present a novel dissolved oxygen monitoring and control system deployed in a municipal
stormwater wetland in Ann Arbor, Michigan, US. This study shows how dissolved oxygen levels
are influenced by real-time control, and we discuss the implications of the results to future
system-level control studies.

*Keywords.* Dissolved oxygen, real-time control, stormwater networks
